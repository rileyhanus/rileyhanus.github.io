                        <h2>Riley Hanus</h2>
                        <p>I'm a multi-instrumentalist, singer, song-writer, and music director in the Raleigh-Durham area. I have 20 years of experience playing live music, running sound, directing bands, and recording. 
                        <br>
                        In Raleigh I manage the group <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riley_from_iowa/" target="_blank">Riley_from_Iowa</a>. We are a versitile group of musicians that can scale from a solo artist to a 6 peice party band. We strive to match the energy of the venue and the crowd, and can tailor our setlist from party rock, to acoustic folk/country, to piano bar. So don't be bashful with your live music requests! Below, you can see a sampling of our ever-growing setlist, example live videos, and booking information.</p>
