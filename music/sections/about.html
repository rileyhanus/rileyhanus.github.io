                        <br>
                        I'm a multi-instrumentalist, singer, song-writer, and band leader in the Raleigh-Durham area. I have 20 years of experience playing live music, running sound, directing bands, and recording. 
                        <br>
                        In Raleigh I play music under the name <a href="https://www.instagram.com/riley_from_iowa/" target="_blank">Riley from Iowa</a>. I'm supported by a group of hand picked musicians in the Triangle, and we can scale from a <strong>solo artist</strong> to a <strong>6 peice party band</strong>. We strive to match the energy of the venue and the crowd, and can tailor our setlist from party rock, to acoustic folk/country, to piano bar. So don't be bashful with your live music requests! Below, you can see a sampling of our ever-growing setlist, example live videos, and booking information.</p>
